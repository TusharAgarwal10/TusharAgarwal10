- 👋 Hi, I’m @TusharAgarwal10
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Math, CS (programming), and Philosophy though I suck at all. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GDL and Python (upper intermediate level).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any research project on the fields I am interested in. 
- 📫 How to reach me -- uh, you don't? jk, jK! Well, I don't actually use any social media app and am not sure if I should share my personal email here yet, so, uh, let's see.
- Anyway, thanks so much for stopping by. Have a good day and happy learning! :)
